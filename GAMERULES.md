You can also choose to shoot, you get 5 arrows and the arrow will move through 3 rooms of your choice.

Watch out for:
* Wumpus, if you walk into the same room as him he will eat you. When near him, you will smell him.
* Holes in the ground, you will fall into them and die. When you get near one you will smell the stench of sewage.
* Bats. If you walk into them they will fly away with you into another room on the board.

There will only be one danger per room.

Remember in which direction you shoot. If you choose the direction you came from you might shoot yourself.
